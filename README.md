## How to use
You can write a Chinese text or copy it from an outer source. If you like, you could press
the last button in the bar, and the "Thousand Characters Classic" would be read from 
external file. 

Press a button Create to create buttons with characters (if you have several lines, you can go
to the previous/next line by << or >>). Then press a character button to obtain vocabulary and
picture of how to write a character. Use music single note to hear a pronounciation, and double note
to hear all the line.

The second line is for your training of wubi. Wubi is a special code to write a character using 
a shape, not a pinyin. You can look at the keyboard with appropriate shapes, and also a hint 
of particular character. 
Of course you can use any method you like, but wubi code is shown below 
a button. You can hide some informations using Hide. 

If you press Tr/Simp (Traditional/Simple), both tratitional and simple (modern) form of sign
would be available by buttons.

Meaning list: my own collection of characters and words from different sources, 
including handbooks. All words with chosen character are shown.

You can shorten a meaning list to three lines, if Show all button is inactive.
